**GetAllRequirementsUseCase:**
- **ADMIN users**: Can see all requirements (unchanged)
- **VISITOR users**: Can see their own requirements + public ones
- Updated filtering logic in repository calls
- Enhanced response DTO to include status field

### 4. Backend Infrastructure Updates ✅

**RequirementRepository:**
- Implemented `findByUserOrPublic()` using TypeORM query builder
- Updated entity mapping to include status field with proper type casting
- Enhanced database entity mapping

- Added RequirementStatus type alias for consistency

### 6. Frontend UI Component Updates ✅

**RequirementPage Component:**
- **Added status dropdown** with NEW, IN_PROGRESS, DONE options
- **Enhanced form layout** with responsive flex layout for mobile/desktop
- **Updated table structure** to include Status column with color-coded badges
- **Implemented role-based visibility**:
  - All users see the requirements list (not just ADMIN)
  - Description explains ADMIN sees all, VISITOR sees own + public
- **Added status badge styling** with different colors per status
- **Enhanced form state management** to include status selection
- **Responsive design improvements** for mobile devices

### 7. Status Badge Color Coding ✅

```typescript

- DONE: Green badges (bg-green-100 text-green-800)
```

## Role-Based Access Control ✅

### ADMIN Users
- Can view **ALL requirements** regardless of privacy settings
- Can see who created each requirement
- Full access to requirement management

### VISITOR Users  
- Can view **their own requirements** (both private and public)
- Can view **public requirements** created by other users
- Cannot see private requirements from other users
- Standard requirement creation capabilities

## API Endpoints Enhanced ✅

### POST /api/requirements
```json
{
  "content": "string",
  "is_private": boolean,
  "status": "NEW" | "IN_PROGRESS" | "DONE"
}
```

### GET /api/requirements
**Returns filtered results based on user role:**
- ADMIN: All requirements
- VISITOR: Own requirements + public requirements

**Response includes status field:**
```json
{
  "results": [{
    "id": "uuid",
    "content": "string", 
    "is_private": boolean,
    "status": "NEW" | "IN_PROGRESS" | "DONE",
    "created_by": "uuid",
    "created_at": "timestamp"
  }]
}
```

## UI/UX Improvements ✅

1. **Better form layout** with responsive design

3. **Color-coded status badges** in the table
4. **Role-based explanatory text** for better UX

6. **Consistent pastel theme** maintained throughout

## Database Migration Notes ✅

The enhanced schema includes:
- Requirements table with status field and CHECK constraint
- Proper foreign key relationships  
- Optimized indexes for performance
- Audit trail fields for compliance

## Testing Status ✅

- ✅ Backend compilation successful
- ✅ Frontend compilation successful  
- ✅ Type safety verified across all layers
- ✅ Role-based filtering logic implemented
- ✅ Status management functionality complete

## Backward Compatibility ✅

- Existing requirements will default to 'NEW' status
